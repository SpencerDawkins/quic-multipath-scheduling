# Path selection for Multiple Paths In QUIC

This repository is used for a draft on path selection in QUIC that have come up in discussions about multipath. The draft is draft-dawkins-quic-multipath-selection.

Issues and pull requests are welcomed here. Substantiative discussion should happen on the QUIC working group mailing list, at quic@ietf.org. 

From the Abstract:

In QUIC working group discussions about proposals to use multiple paths, an obvious question came up - given multiple paths, how does QUIC select paths to send packets over?

The answer to that question may inform decisions in the QUIC working group about the scope of any multipath extensions considered for experimentation and adoption. 

This document is intended to summarize aspects of path selection from those contributions and conversations.
